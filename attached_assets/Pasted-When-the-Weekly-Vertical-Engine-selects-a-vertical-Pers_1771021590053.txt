When the Weekly Vertical Engine selects a vertical:

Persist it in memory as selectedVertical

Show it across all pages as a top system banner

2. Global Vertical Banner (Persistent Across App)

At the very top of every page (Dashboard, Signals, Leads, Content, Ingest):

Add a thin but visually dominant banner:

“🎯 Weekly Focus: {Industry Name}”
Subtext:
“Primary AI Demand: {AI Employee}”

Include:

“Change Focus” button

“Lock Vertical” toggle (manual override)

Date selected

If no vertical is selected:
Show:
“No vertical focus yet. Ingest signals to activate.”

3. Vertical Filter Defaults

When a Weekly Vertical is active:

Signals page auto-filters to selected vertical

Leads page auto-filters to selected vertical

Content page auto-generates content ONLY for selected vertical

Export to Sheets defaults to selected vertical

Add a visible “Viewing: Weekly Vertical Only” indicator.

Allow manual override filter but default back to vertical focus.

4. Content Mode Adjustment

When generating weekly content:

Inject this instruction into the content generation prompt:

“You are generating content ONLY for operators in the {selectedVertical.industry} industry. Use real pain quotes from this vertical. Make the pain specific to their workflows.”

Remove generic SMB language.

Make vertical specificity mandatory.

5. Vertical Density Meter

On Dashboard:

Replace empty center panel with:

VERTICAL DOMINANCE PANEL

Show:

Total signals in selected vertical

Average pain score

Growth rate (7d vs prior 7d)

% of all signals belonging to this vertical

“Cluster Strength” indicator:

Weak

Forming

Dominant

If one vertical exceeds 35% of signals:
Show:
“🔥 Vertical Breakout Detected”

6. Cluster Lock Mode

Add button:

“Commit to This Vertical”

When clicked:

System locks vertical for 14 days

Adds a tag to all exported leads:
“WAVE_1_{industry}”

Adds note to content generation:
“You are in vertical domination mode.”

7. Rename Sections for Identity Shift

Change labels:

“Vertical Intelligence” → “Vertical Domination”
“Emerging Clusters” → “Cluster Radar”
“Signals” → “Pain Signals”
“Leads” → “Operator Targets”

8. Add Vertical Strategy Output

When vertical is selected, auto-generate:

Suggested lead magnet title

Suggested cold email hook

Suggested LinkedIn post hook

Suggested demo framing angle

Display in Weekly Focus Panel.

Do NOT change backend storage structure beyond selectedVertical state.

Preserve in-memory logic.

Keep UI consistent with existing Tailwind / Shadcn style.

Goal:
SignalLayerOS should now feel like a vertical conquest machine, not a neutral signal dashboard.
