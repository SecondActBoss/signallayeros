We are adding a Weekly Vertical Focus Engine to SignalLayerOS.

Goal:
Automatically select the highest-leverage vertical for focused GTM activity each week.

Definition of Weekly Vertical Focus:

From ranked industries and cluster detection data:

Select the vertical that:
- Has the highest totalPainScore in last 30 days
- AND has growthRate > 0.3
- AND has avgPainScore >= 3.5

If no vertical meets all conditions:
Fallback to highest totalPainScore overall.

Backend Requirements:

1. Create new endpoint:
GET /api/verticals/focus

2. Logic:
- Pull ranked vertical data
- Pull cluster data
- Apply focus selection rules
- Identify dominantPainSignal
- Identify most frequent routed AI Employee in that vertical
- Pull top 3 highest-score leads from that vertical
- Extract their pain quotes

3. Generate structured response:

{
  industry: "Veterinary Clinics",
  reasonSelected: "Highest pain density with strong growth in inbound friction",
  dominantPainSignal: "Inbound Friction",
  primaryAIAgentDemand: "Inbound Revenue Agent",
  topPainQuotes: [
    "We're missing calls constantly.",
    "Appointments fall through the cracks.",
    "Staff turnover is killing response times."
  ],
  suggestedBlueprintTitle: "AI Staffing Blueprint for Independent Veterinary Clinics",
  suggestedContentAngles: [
    "Inbound revenue leakage",
    "Staff burnout from phone chaos",
    "Why missed calls are silent churn"
  ]
}

Frontend Requirements:

1. Add new Dashboard section:
"Weekly Vertical Focus"

2. Display:
   - Industry name
   - Why selected
   - Primary AI Employee
   - Suggested Blueprint Title
   - 3 Pain Quotes
   - CTA buttons:
        - Generate Blueprint
        - Generate Content
        - Export High-Intent Leads

3. When "Generate Content" is clicked:
   Automatically pass industry + pain quotes into ContentLayerOS as vertical focus context.

Constraints:
- Must use existing in-memory data
- Must not break Manus ingestion
- Must not increase dashboard load time significantly
- Clean dark UI consistent with existing components

Purpose:
This turns SignalLayerOS into a weekly GTM decision engine instead of a passive analytics tool.
