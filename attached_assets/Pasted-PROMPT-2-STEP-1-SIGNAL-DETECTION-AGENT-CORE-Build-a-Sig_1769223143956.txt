PROMPT 2 — STEP 1: SIGNAL DETECTION AGENT (CORE)
Build a Signal Detection Agent that ingests daily research output

(from tools like Manus or similar agentic research sources).

This agent does NOT look for AI interest.

It looks for coordination + turnover pain in SMB operators.

Target ICP:

- Founders, Operators, COOs, Heads of Ops, Revenue Owners

- 5–100 person companies

- US-based

- Growing faster than systems

- Paying close to the money

- Exhausted by coordination + fragile human roles

Primary pain signals (implicit or explicit):

- “Busy all day but nothing moved”

- Everything depends on me

- Follow-ups falling through cracks

- Missed calls / slow responses

- Turnover, rehiring fatigue

- Lost roles causing breakdown

- Work stops when people stop

Strict exclusions:

- Enterprise procurement language

- Governance-first questions

- AI curiosity without pain

- Tool comparisons

- People who want to train or manage agents

- Meta-agent or orchestration enthusiasm

Output structured JSON only:

{

  person_or_company_name,

  role,

  industry,

  company_size_estimate,

  location,

  pain_quote,

  pain_summary_in_plain_language,

  source_url,

  date_detected

}

This agent prioritizes first-person language and lived experience.

Goal is emotional obviousness, not volume.


PROMPT 3 — STEP 2: LEAD SCORING + AI EMPLOYEE ROUTING
Implement Lead Scoring and Routing logic on top of Signal Detection output.

Scoring model (clamp to 1–5):

Base:

- Every qualified signal starts at 2

Add:

+1 Coordination overload (follow-ups, handoffs, dependency)

+1 Turnover / role fragility (rehiring, quitting, ghosting)

+1 Inbound friction (missed calls, slow replies)

+1 Revenue proximity (leads, deals, pipeline mentioned)

Score meanings:

5 = emotionally obvious buyer

3–4 = strong follow-up candidate

1–2 = content insight only

Route each lead to ONE primary AI Employee using hard rules:

1) Missed Call Follow-Up

   - Missed calls, voicemail complaints, after-hours loss

2) Appointment Reminder + Rescheduler

   - No-shows, cancellations, calendar chaos

3) Lead Reactivation Agent

   - Dormant leads, CRM rot, paid leads not closed

4) Outbound Prospector

   - Manual outbound, pipeline creation fatigue

5) Email Automation Specialist

   - Inbox overload, forgotten replies, manual follow-ups

6) Support Response Agent (Omni-Channel)

   - Customer complaints, response delays, channel chaos

7) Call Feedback (MEDDIC) & Follow-Up Engine

   - Calls happening but deals stalling, founder reviewing calls

8) Marketing Coordinator

   - Inconsistent posting, founder doing marketing themselves

Tie-breakers:

- Revenue-impacting agents win

- Inbound beats outbound

- Fastest relief wins

Enrich each lead with:

{

  confidence_score,

  recommended_ai_employee_role,

  agentlayeros_employee_name,

  why_this_ai_employee_replaces_or_backfills_work

}


PROMPT 4 — STEP 2 OUTPUT: GOOGLE SHEETS (OUTREACH)
Create a Google Sheets integration that appends one row per qualified lead.

Sheet columns:

- Date detected

- Lead / Company name

- Role

- Industry

- Company size estimate

- Location

- Raw pain quote

- Plain-language pain summary

- Confidence score (1–5)

- Recommended AI Employee

- Why this AI Employee fits

- Source URL

This sheet is used for personalized outbound outreach.

No deduping required in v1.


PROMPT 5 — STEP 3: CONTENTLAYEROS INGESTION
Integrate this system with our internal tool: ContentLayerOS.

For each qualified signal, generate an Insight Record

separate from the Lead Record.

Insight Record schema:

{

  insight_theme,

  raw_pain_language,

  normalized_problem,

  operator_emotion,

  agentlayeros_angle,

  suggested_post_angles: [

    "contrarian",

    "story",

    "lesson",

    "quiet win"

  ],

  source_type,

  date_detected

}

Create an ingestion endpoint:

POST /api/content-layer/ingest

Payload includes:

- run_id

- list of Insight Records

- applied_contexts: ["ICP", "Positioning"]

- source: "SignalLayerOS"

- cadence: "weekly"


PROMPT 6 — WEEKLY CONTENT FLOW (CONTENTLAYEROS)
Inside ContentLayerOS, enable a Weekly Run workflow.

Weekly Run behavior:

- Pull last 7 days of Insight Records

- Cluster by:

  - coordination pain

  - turnover fatigue

  - inbound friction

- Generate:

  - 2 LinkedIn drafts

  - 2 X (Twitter) drafts

Support toggles:

- ICP context

- Positioning context

- Be Contrary

Preserve raw language.

Do not over-polish.

Content should sound inevitable, not promotional.


PROMPT 7 — SYSTEM PRINCIPLES (LOCK THESE)
System rules (non-negotiable):

- Signal detection is pain-based, not AI-based

- AI Employee language appears only in routing and recommendation

- No user-facing configuration

- Fewer, better leads > volume

- Relief > intelligence

- Reliability > novelty

- Execution > explanation

This system is designed to surface buyers

before they know they want AI Employees.
